Battle ship using Java FX
to run make sure your IDE is compatable with Java FX (I recommend net beans)
first you place your ships once that is done your game starts
click the computer's grid to attack the will retaliate instantly
once all battle ships are sunken on ether side the player whos battle ships remain win!
